Not Fast Just Furious Banking App


Description



User Story

I am an upcoming adult. I want to get an online bank account to keep 
track of my finances at my convenience. In this bank account, I must
be able to add money, view my transaction history and transfer
money between my personal accounts. There must be options to have either
a savings or debit account. When I sign up, I can save my login
information. When I log in, the login page will take me to my homepage
showing me my account balance.
